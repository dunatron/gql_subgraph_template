## There is a right way

Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise

## For an Apollo Federated Graph

## Step 1 clone

## step 2

read the docs

## step 3

get creative as fuck with those cheap `key=>value` databases, ignore principles

and tell your manager baddies. <==== Very key

## step 4 Let Apollo handle everything

Don't do anything special. I know you think you are. But just stop. Things to do

## step 5 check Everything

Shit should be fast as fuck boiii

```
Hint tests, we can mock them to be slow when they should be fast
```
